Daily weather update from Weather Underground to pre-configured Telegram chats

If you want to see the current weather and the daily forecast at a glance without having to unlock your phone and to launch the WeatherUnderground app, you may find this little Node.js app useful. It requires a valid WU API key and one or more chat IDs for the Telegram bot. Currently, it sends compressed weather info at 06:44 on weekdays and at 07:55 on weekends. I chose this schedule because it fits my schedule better. You may want to customize it.

More docs to be added when time permits.
